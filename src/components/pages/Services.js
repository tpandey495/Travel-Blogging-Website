<p className="paragraph">Running the Rat race ,scheming to swim with the sharks. Wondering what is left in rat race after conquering the corner office. Realized that 
I have run a lot and now is the time to stop running and start traveling, because ‚Äù The Journey Is The Destination.

This blog is getting serious about me and is listed as one of the top travel 
blogs in India and hopefully we will have a steady long innings. If you have  
gone through the blog it is not just about the places we visit, it is about 
what we discovered, liked and disliked as family. I am your regular everyday 
traveler who visits different places with family like most Indians. We go to 
beaches, mountains, tourist spots, discover our own city, foreign countries, 
and also the so called offbeat places e.g people call Sikkim an offbeat travel 
destination, which I visited more than 2 decades ago. So I am not sure about all 
this noise about traveler / tourists and different kind of travelers that 
people claim to be. I am simply happy to pack my bags and go to places I have 
always wanted to see if they happen to be in vogue wonderful otherwise I am happy 
to visit places that friends recommend or I may visit due to a business trip an 
sneak a weekend out  Though at times I do write about my solo travels when 
I rough it out with backpacking, hiking etc; but there too the focus is to write 
some thing that we can enjoy together as a family.
